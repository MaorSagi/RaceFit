# RaceFit

The main goal of the RaceFit is to help professional cycling team coaches to allocate cyclist to races. Additional goal is to model the decision making process of the coach and understand the most important factors in the decision. I invite you to read the paper "Modelling Coach Decisions in Professional Cycling Teams", describing the method more deeply.

You can find the poster and the presentation presented in the ECML-PKDD 2022 conference in the [*deliverables*](https://github.com/MaorSagi/RaceFit/tree/master/deliverables) directory.

Also, the paper is available [here](https://dtai.cs.kuleuven.be/events/MLSA22/papers/MLSA22_paper_9312.pdf) and the poster [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DBAcgUwpGI6oHocyJHQfuSA4MrQfk17D/view?usp=share_link).

## Installation
It required to have a python environment containing the necessary packages. For you convenience, a file named 'requirements.txt' is attached from which you can install the libraries easily.

In order to install the environment from the file run the following command:

```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
```
    
## Data
